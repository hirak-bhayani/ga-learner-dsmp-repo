### Project Overview

 Working on an open dataset by Lending Club, an organization which connects borrowers & investors. As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back. Some of the variables in the dataset are Customer ID, purpose of the loan, interest rate, FICO score, delinquency details & so on.

**Problem Statement**
What is the probability that the borrower paid back their loan in full?
