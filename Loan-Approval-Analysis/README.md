### Project Overview

 **Problem Statement:**
Dream Housing Finance Inc. specializes in home loans across different market segments - rural, urban and semi-urban. Thier loan eligibility process is based on customer details provided while filling an online application form. To create a targeted marketing campaign for different segments, they have asked for a comprehensive analysis of the data collected so far. The dataset had details of 614 customers with features like - Loan_ID, Gender, Marital Status, Education, No. of dependents, Loan Amount, Loan status and some more.


### Learnings from the project

 My key takeaway from this project was a better understanding of Panda dataframes & concepts like dataframe slicing, row & column operations, pivot tables, aggregation of dataframes.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 - The first step after loading the data was to differentiate categorical & numerical variables to understand the features of my dataset better.
- Next step was to cleanse the data as some fields were either left blank intentionally/was missing. These were filled by appropriate values.
- I then delved into the average loan amount taken by an individual by creating a pivot table based on their gender, marital status & employment details.
- A bifurcation was then done between self-employed & other individuals to understand the loan grant/approval percentages.
- Susequently, I filtered out applicant whose loan tenure was greater than 25 years to keep the data handy in case of a government audit.
- The final step was to analyse the credit history of an applicant basis their income & to observe if there were any trends there.
