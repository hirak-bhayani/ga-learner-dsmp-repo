### Project Overview

 **Problem Statement**
I have been hired by the stakeholders of Dream Housing Finance company to help them get visual insights on the company's operations. Using the data visualization techniques I learnt, I have attempted to visualize the data and see if I can help the stakeholders arrive at some inference based on the visual plots.

### Learnings from the project

 This project has helped me better understand the following concepts:
- Bar plotting
- Scatter plotting
- Kernel Density plotting
- Subplot operations
- Axes modifications


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 - The initial approach was  to gauge if the company had more loan approvals/disapprovals. This was done by plotting a bar graph on the loan status.
- The company provides financial assistance across varied regions (Eg.: Urban, rural, semi-urban). One interesting statistic that stakeholders usually want to see is the loan approval distribution across the regions. I have plotted the same using an unstacked bar graph. This helped me answer basic queries like which region had the highest & lowest no. of loan approvals? It also answered which region had the maximum difference between loan approvals and loan rejections.
- The next step was to see if the education level (graduate/non-graduate) had any impact on loan approval status and to see which group performed better.
- The consequent step was to plot an overlapping density plot which helped me analyse if the education level also had any impact on the loan distribution amount i.e. Is Smarter = Richer?
- For any finance institiution to be successful in it's loan lending system, there has to be a correlation between the borrower's income and loan amount he/she is lent. My final step was to plot scatter diagrams that helped me understand if there was any relation between income & loan amount.
